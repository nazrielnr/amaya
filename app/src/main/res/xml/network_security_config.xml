        Allow cleartext HTTP to local network hosts only (Ollama, LM Studio, etc.)
        Android network security config does not support IP wildcards, so we allow
        cleartext globally but restrict trust anchors to system CAs for HTTPS.
        For production, users accessing public APIs always use HTTPS anyway.
